## Status Update 20-01-2024

Our current model consists of agents with different price expectations, and allowance needs, that trade with each otherâ€”this way a market dynamic is created. The behaviour of the agents has a great influence on the behaviour of the market. To test different strategies, we now wondered how we should proceed, because of this feedback loop. Should we only use a subset of agents that deploy different strategies and measure the effectiveness of the agents (focus on the effectiveness of trading strategies for single agents) while the other agents stabilize the market, or should we change the general behaviour of all agents and then track how the market changes (focus on market behavior)? Or maybe something in between?

### Goal of the model/how can we play with the model:
- how hard can we cut CO2 before everything collapses?
- is our model close to the real data (price/co2 emission reduction/supply-demand)?
- market analysis: how companies react on co2 reduction measures? how many companies die/stop producing?
- optimal trading strategies withing market (Austria within Austria, Austria vs EU, EU vs EU)?
- concentrate on profit & allowances reduction? are the companies still making profit when the number of allowances goes down?


### Other questions:
- data to use for the market: (Austria within Austria, Austria vs EU, EU vs EU)?
- is okay to use data for init directly or should sample based on real data?
- what to concentrate on during the presentation?
